## Who I Am

I'm Matthew P. Slanker, a technologist with a passion for building things that work and sharing knowledge along the way. This site represents my journey through the ever-evolving landscape of technology, from kernel development to web applications, from system administration to creative coding.

## What You'll Find Here

This knowledge base contains:

- **Technical tutorials** and how-to guides
- **Project showcases** and experiments
- **Thoughts on technology** and its impact
- **Lessons learned** from building and breaking things

## The SKB Story

The name "SKB" has evolved over time, but it represents the core of what this site is about: a place where **Systems**, **Knowledge**, and **Brilliance** come together. Whether it's debugging a kernel module, setting up a homelab, or exploring generative art, it's all about the synthesis of knowledge and creativity.

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not tinkering with technology, you might find me:
- Exploring Japanese culture and language
- Creating digital art and visualizations
- Reading about philosophy and design
- Contributing to open source projects

## Connect

Feel free to reach out if you have questions, want to collaborate, or just want to chat about technology. You can find me on various platforms through the links in the footer.
