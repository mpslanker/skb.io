# Advanced Docker Techniques for Production

Docker has become the de facto standard for containerization, but many developers only scratch the surface of its capabilities. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore advanced techniques that will take your Docker skills to the next level.

## Multi-Stage Builds

One of the most powerful features of Docker is multi-stage builds. They allow you to use multiple `FROM` statements in a single Dockerfile, enabling you to build your application in one stage and package it in another.

### Example: Node.js Application

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Production stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS production
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Health Checks

Implementing proper health checks ensures your containers are actually ready to serve traffic.

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1
```

## Production Optimization

### Layer Caching

Optimize your Dockerfile for better layer caching:

```dockerfile
# Bad: Changes to source code invalidate package installation
COPY . .
RUN npm install

# Good: Package files copied first, then source code
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
```

### Security Best Practices

- Use non-root users
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Use specific image tags
- Minimize attack surface

## Coming Soon

This tutorial is a work in progress. I'll be adding:

- [ ] Docker Compose for complex applications
- [ ] Container orchestration with Docker Swarm
- [ ] Monitoring and logging strategies
- [ ] Performance optimization techniques
- [ ] Security hardening practices
