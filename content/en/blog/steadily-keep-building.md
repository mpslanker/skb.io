Rome wasn't built in
a day, so maybe lower
your expectations.

I frequently find myself needing to be reminded of this.

In my younger years, learning was easy, and most things just came naturally.  Rarely having to study, things simply stuck without considerable effort.  As a result, I have come to expect all things to work in this fashion.  However, those were often limited in scope, concepts without significant depth.  As I have gotten older, it has become apparent that some things demand time to learn and ingrain.  The more complex and layered an idea is, the more time it necessitates.

This page endeavors to be a guidepost, a place to return so that we may reflect on what we wish to achieve and why. And a reminder that every step forward is one less that remains.
