This site was borne out of frustration.  Many times I have worked on a project only to return to it later
and find that I had pretty much forgotten everything about it.  Additionally, I find myself wish I to not
only catalog my projects but share the things I have learned along the way and give back to the community
that has helped me learn and grow.

<span class="h4"> So what does SKB stand for?</span>
<p class="mt-4 mb-0">SKB can mean many things.  Originally, it was an inside joke between me and some colleagues at a previous company.  I like to think it means "Slanker's Knowledge Base", which is what this site is
intended to be.  Also I like to think of it as place to consult when "shit keeps breaking" but you can feel free to
attribute your own meaning to it.</p>
