# Learning Obsidian for Knowledge Management

Just started exploring Obsidian as a potential replacement for my current note-taking system. The graph view is fascinating - it's like having a visual map of your thoughts and how they connect.

## Initial Impressions

**What I like:**
- The graph view is genuinely useful for seeing connections
- Markdown-first approach feels natural
- Plugin ecosystem is extensive
- Local-first storage (no cloud dependency)

**What's challenging:**
- Learning curve is steeper than expected
- Too many options can be overwhelming
- Need to develop a consistent linking strategy

## Current Setup

Trying to keep it simple for now:
- Daily notes for quick thoughts
- Project folders for larger topics
- Tags for cross-cutting themes
- Minimal plugins to start

## Questions to Explore

- How does this compare to Notion for project management?
- Can it handle code snippets effectively?
- What's the best way to organize technical documentation?
- How to maintain consistency across different note types?

## Next Steps

1. Set up a proper folder structure
2. Experiment with different linking strategies
3. Try the Kanban plugin for project tracking
4. Explore community plugins for technical writing
