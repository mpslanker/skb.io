# Blender 3D Artwork Collection

A showcase of 3D artwork created using Blender, demonstrating various techniques in modeling, texturing, lighting, and rendering. Each piece represents a different aspect of the 3D creation process.

## Featured Pieces

### Bedroom Diorama
*Created: January 2024*

A cozy bedroom scene featuring detailed furniture, soft lighting, and atmospheric rendering. This piece was created as part of my Blender learning journey and demonstrates:

- **Modeling**: Custom furniture and props
- **Texturing**: Realistic material application
- **Lighting**: Natural daylight simulation
- **Composition**: Rule of thirds and depth

### Abstract Geometry
*Created: February 2024*

An exploration of abstract forms and materials, focusing on:

- **Procedural Materials**: Node-based texturing
- **Lighting**: Dramatic contrast and shadows
- **Composition**: Minimalist design principles
- **Rendering**: Cycles engine optimization

### Character Study
*Created: March 2024*

A stylized character model showcasing:

- **Sculpting**: Digital sculpting techniques
- **Retopology**: Clean mesh topology
- **UV Mapping**: Efficient texture coordinates
- **Rigging**: Basic bone structure
